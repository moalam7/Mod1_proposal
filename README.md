I have two proposals, let me know which one you guys recommend. Thank you!

Proposal #1:

PerScholasMon
A game concept inspired by Pokemon and Per Scholas. The game features the player as a trainer and battles Perscholasmons. The map will be based on Per Scholas based on the Bronx, and its various rooms. It will feature Per Scholas members as NPCs which will help give the user directions. The goal is to eliminate the wild Perscholasmons that has infiltrated Per Scholas.
Since creating an entire "pokemon" universe is going to be difficult in a week's span, the goal of the game temporarily will be to defeat a certain number of perscholasmons that have infiltrated and you will be given a high score at the end of the game. Points will be based on various actions in the game and your overall and your entire adventure will be timed which will also be a factor in point production. 

Other features:
-Starting page when you begin, come back to this when you die. You only have one life if your perscholasmon dies
-Story plot page that explains what is going on
    -The text in this entire game will be displayed one at a time really quickly with sound during conversations, etc. Will have to use JS or css animations for this 
- Page to choose your character, boy or girl, and type in name
- Page to choose your initial perscholasmon
-Mapping out of entire PS Bronx
-Fight scenes with other perscholasmon - might make this simple since so much to do, not like the original pokemon. Will attempt a more difficult and orginal style of play if able to.
    -Fights will have perscholasmons having hp, abilities to choose from, and animations when choosing these abilities. 
    -Item slot if possible that can be recieved by talking to certain NPCs
-To win the game, it will be designed to be finished in under average time of less than 5-7 minutes
-Sprites, game loops, etc.

Proposal #2:
A zombie style game, where the user begins in the middle of the map and zombies(or other people or monsters, etc - theme of the game is TBD) are approaching the player. Their movement will not simply be linear but they will zigzag and the speed they approach you will be calculated with the time that passes in the game or the number of monsters will increase ---  can also make it steady and make levels of difficult you can choose in the beginning. The user's sprite will be controlled by WASD, or arrow keys, and clicking the mouse in the direction you want to shoot will shoot the user's gun or whatever weapon. --- this is subject to change depending, also want to see if I can use the mouse to choose direction and click the mouse to move character while just pressing a button to shoot in the direction of the mouse (this is more standard in current games)---

Other features:
-Point system for monsters killed
-Main menu -- to start the game, perhaps choose your character, controls option, etc.
-Death menu -- screen when you die to restart, go to main menu, etc. Can even show your apm while playing if using the mouse method and figure that out 
-Will have to implement collision detection when user shoots at monsters or when monsters touch the user
-Sprites, game loop, etc.
