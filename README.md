Proposal:
A zombie style game, where the user begins in the middle of the map and zombies(or other people or monsters, etc - theme of the game is TBD) are approaching the player. Their movement will not simply be linear but they will zigzag and the speed they approach you will be calculated with the time that passes in the game or the number of monsters will increase ---  can also make it steady and make levels of difficult you can choose in the beginning. The user's sprite will be controlled by WASD, or arrow keys, and clicking the mouse in the direction you want to shoot will shoot the user's gun or whatever weapon. --- this is subject to change depending, also want to see if I can use the mouse to choose direction and click the mouse to move character while just pressing a button to shoot in the direction of the mouse (this is more standard in current games)---

Other features:
-Point system for monsters killed
-Main menu -- to start the game, perhaps choose your character, controls option, etc.
-Death menu -- screen when you die to restart, go to main menu, etc. Can even show your apm while playing if using the mouse method and figure that out 
-Will have to implement collision detection when user shoots at monsters or when monsters touch the user
-Sprites, game loop, etc.
